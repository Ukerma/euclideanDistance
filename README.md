<h1>📐 Euclidean Distance Calculator</h1>
<p>
   This project was created as part of the <strong>IBM with Kodluyoruz: CyberSkills Program</strong>. It calculates the Euclidean distance between pairs of points in a 2D plane, demonstrating a simple use of mathematical functions in Python.
</p>

<h2>🛠️ Features</h2>
<ul>
   <li> Calculates the Euclidean distance between pairs of points in a 2D plane.</li>
   <li> Finds and displays all calculated distances.</li>
   <li> Identifies and prints the minimum distance among all pairs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>⚙️ Technical Details</h2>
<ul>
   <li> Developed in <strong>Python</strong>.</li>
   <li> Utilizes Python's <code>math</code> library for mathematical operations.</li>
   <li> Designed for simplicity and clarity, with easily customizable point inputs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🚀 How to Use</h2>
<ol>
   <li> Clone or download the repository to your local machine.</li>
   <li> Open the file in any Python IDE or text editor.</li>
   <li> Modify the <code>points</code> list to include the coordinates you want to calculate distances for.</li>
   <li> Run the script to see the results:</li>
   <ul>
      <li>All calculated distances will be printed.</li>
      <li>The minimum distance among all pairs will be displayed.</li>
   </ul>
</ol>

<h2>💡 Example Output</h2>
<pre>
All distances: [5.0, 7.615773105863909, 7.0710678118654755, 5.830951894845301, 6.324555320336759, 6.4031242374328485]
Minimum distance: 5.0
